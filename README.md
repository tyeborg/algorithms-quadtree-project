The objective of this project is to code a QuadTree (level n > 1) based on the *long_wgs*, *lat_wgs* location from each row from the retailer's file. Each leaf of the Quadtree holds a list where each element is a `TupleT`: (`long_wgs`, `lat_wgs`, `retailer`, `postcode`).

* **Input**: A pair *Longitude*, *Latitude*.
* **Output**: An ST structure that corresponds to the retailer located on the *Latitude*, *Longitude* provided.

**Procedure:**
1. Ask the user for a `longitude` and a `latitude` from the retailer's file (uk_glx_open_retail_points_v20_202104.csv).
2. Once you located the correct leaf, search on the list for the correct `TupleT`.
3. Use the retailer/postcode located in `TupleT` to search for `ST` on the hash table.

For example, if the input is -4.452243148 (longitude), 54.16746806 (latitude), the output should be:

```bash
Please enter longitude: -4.452243148
'-4.452243148' has been accepted...

Please enter latitude: 54.16746806
'54.16746806' has been accepted...

## Installation
Clone this repository by `git clone https://github.com/tyeborg/algorithms-quadtree-project.git`.

Navigate to the `code` folder/change the working directory by entering the following in the command line: `cd code`. Ensure `main.py` is in the new working directory as `./uk_glx_open_retail_points_v20_202104.csv` and execute `python -u main.py` to run the program.

## Project Evaluation
*"Excellent job! Congratulations."* - Roberto Murcio

The Quadtree is programmed from scratch with a robust and well-designed strategy. The treeâ€™s leaves hold the triplet T. The code allows the user to perform more than one search by longitude and latitude and provides the functionality to end the program. The output is presented in the form of a table, where each column is labelled.
Coding style is remarkable (proper use of data frames in Python); sensible variable names; proper comments and indentation).

**Grade**: 92.00 / 100.00
